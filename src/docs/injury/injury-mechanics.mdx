## Loading issues

The pulleys, while being the most resistent structure of the flexor-tendon pulley system, can only withstand a certain amount of load. Whenever the load placed on the pulleys goes past the threshold, an injury occurs.

The load placed on the pulley comes from the tendons of the flexor muscles that push against the pulley, similarly to how the line pushes against the eyelets in a fishing rod.

## Disequality between muscle strength and ligament strength

Throught our climbing carrear, we become stronger and more efficient in transfering force to our fingertips. However, due to their fibrous nature, ligamets's resistence doesn't increase much during this process. This leads us, the harder our climbings become, progressively closer to the injury threshold of annular pulleys. Therefore, proper climbing technique and load distribution become crucial.

## 2 types of injury

Pulleys injuries are divided in 2 broad categories:

- Overuse injuries:

  - This happens when the flexor-tendon pulley system is stressed for prolonged periods of time and cannot fully recover. It usually leads to inflammation of the area and occationally to physical damage of the pulleys. The main characteristic is that this is a process that builds over time and progressively worsens.

- Sudden injuries:
  - This type of injury happens when a there is a spike in the load placend on the pulleys, and the sum of the forces placed on the pulley is higher thatn the injury-threshold. Usually, some kind of acceleration is involved, for instance a fall or a dynamic move.

Obviously, both types of injuries can of course coexist and influence each other.
