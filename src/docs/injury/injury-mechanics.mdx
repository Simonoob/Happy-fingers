## Loading issues

The pulleys, while being the most resistent structure of the flexor-tendon pulley system, can only withstand a certain amount of load. Whenever the load placed on the pulleys goes past the theshold, an injury occurs.

The load placed on the pulley comes from the tendons of the flexor muscles that push against the pulley, similarly to how the line pushes against the eyelets in a fishing rod.

Throught our climbing carrer, we become stronger and more efficient in producing force to our fingertips. However, due to their fibrous nature, ligamets's resistence doen't increase much during this process. This leads us progressively closer to the injury threshold of annular pulleys.

The most important pulleys for us are the annular pulleys, since they are the ones most frequently injured during climbing.

Of these, A2 and A4 are true fibro-osseous pulleys, making them the strongest. The others (A1, A3 and A5) are more flexible in order to allow compression during flexion of the digit without impairing the tendon.
