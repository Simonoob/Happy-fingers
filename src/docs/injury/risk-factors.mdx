## Not all risk factors have equal weight

The literature on pulley injuries is still in development and many potential risk factors are still in debate. However, it is already clear that climbing technique plays the most important role in injury rates.

### Age and experience

The older you are and the more experience you have in climbing, the hicher is the risk of injury. However, no particular age group or experience has yet been identified. Therefore, this only means that the more experience you have, the more you should be mindful of your climbing technique.

### Difficulty

The better you become at climbing, the more demanding the routes become. Obviusly then, more difficult climbs should be apporached with more focus, attention and preparation.

### BMI

As we have already discussed, the mechanics behind pulley injuries rotate around the amout of load that the pulley has to withstand. Therefore, having a higher BMI (body mass index), might play a factor in how likely you are to get injured, as well as reinjured.

### Climbing volume

Climbing volume has an impact predominantely on overuse injuries. Specifically, higher weekly volume is linked to higher risk of injury. Be mindful about your weekly schedule and make sure to fully recover before starting a new week of training.

### Crimp grip on dynamic moves

The annular pulley A2 is most likely to be injured when loaded exxentrically, and the crimp position places a particularly high load on it. Therefore, performing a dynamic move using a crimp, especially when landing, represents a significant risk factor.
