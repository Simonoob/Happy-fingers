## Incidence

The most injured area among recreational and professional climbers is always the upper limb, taking up between 37% and 91% of all the injuries. Of all upper limb injuries, finger injuries are the most common, with flexor tendon pulley injuries being the most frequent.

## injury mechanism

The pulleys, while being the most resistant structure of the flexor-tendon pulley system, can only withstand a certain amount of load. Whenever the load placed on the pulleys goes past the threshold, an injury occurs.

The load placed on the pulley comes from the tendons of the [flexor muscles](/anatomy/muscles) that push against the pulley, similarly to how the line pushes against the eyelets in a fishing rod.

## Grips

### Open hand

In the context of pulley injuries, the open hand grip is definitely the safest option. The [interphalangeal joints](/anatomy/bones) are in a relaxed position, with specifically the PIP joint having an angle greater than 90 degrees.

### Closed crimp

The thumb actively "locks" the [DIP](/anatomy/bones), providing mode structural support and adding the pulling force of the thumb to the grip.

The closed crimp is the technique that places on the [A2 pulley](/anatomy/pulleys) the highest load compared to the other grips. A recreational climber can load the A2 pulley with forces close to 380N when using this position. This load gets even higher if performing dynamic moves. A2, which is the strongest annular pulley, is particularly in danger with this grip, with its maximal resistance being 400N.

The Closed crimp should be used only when all the other gripping methods fail. If you find yourself using the crimp as your main grip, it might be worth practicing the use of other grips on easier routes to get you accustomed to prefer them.

### Grip sequence

Your first choice should always be an open hand grip when approaching a move. If that doesn't fit the hold, you can progressively move to heavier techniques.

## Bottom line

The key to avoiding pulley injuries is proper load management. You can decrease the load placed on your pulleys by improving your climbing technique:

- avoid frequent use of the crimp
- use your feet as much as possible to take the load off your hands
- Never approach dynos using a crimp, especially a closed one
- Manage weekly climbing volume and intensity to avoid overuse
