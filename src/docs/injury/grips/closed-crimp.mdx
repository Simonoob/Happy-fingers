## Overview

The recruitment of the thumb in this position is unique and makes it an advantageous grip to use on smaller and more difficult handholds. The thumb actively "locks" the [DIP](/anatomy/bones), providing mode structural support and adding the pulling force of the thumb to the grip.

## Why it is dangerous

The closed crimp is the technique that places on the A2 pulley the highest load compared to the other grips. Due to the recruitment of the thumb, this technique is particularly powerful and useful when facing harder climbs, making it the favourite grip of many climbers.

Overuse is particularly dangerous in this case due to the high forces involved in the technique. A recreational climber can load the A2 pulley with forces close to 380N when using this position. This load gets even higher if performing dynamic moves. A2, which is the strongest annular pulley, is particularly in danger with this grip, with its maximal resistance being 400N.

The closed crimp can be particularly dangerous for the pulleys, especially if used frequently.

## How to use it

Closed crimp is, and should be treated, as the strongest yet most demanding grip technique. This means that you should use it only when all the other gripping methods fail. Additionally, if you find yourself using the crimp as your main grip, it might be worth practicing the use of other grips on easier routes to get you accustomed to prefer them.
