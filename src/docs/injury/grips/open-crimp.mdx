The crimp grip is used to exert maximal force on a small ledge. The characteristics of this grip are flexion of 90-100 degrees of the proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) and hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal ones (DIP). Furthermore, the grip becomes progressively more common in harder climbs.

The position can then be subdivided into two additional categories, open and closed crimp. The classification refers to the position of the thumb that can “lock” the DIP and provide the maximal holding force or rest aside the other fingers.

## Open crimp

The open crimp is useful when an open-hand grip is not suitable and it should always be preferred to the closed crimp.

While using an open crimp, the forces placed on the pulleys are high. However, this position is sometimes needed and cannot be avoided, especially in harder climbs.

An open crimp is a safer option than its closed version, but it is still very demanding. You should always avoid using this grip on dynamic moves and avoid overuse.
