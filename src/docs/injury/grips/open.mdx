In the context of pulley injuries, the open hand grip is definately the safest option. The [interphalangeal joints](/anatomy/bones) are in a relaxed position, with specifically the PIP joint having an angle grater than 90 degrees. This drastically decreases the load on the pulleys, specifically on A2. Furthermore, the increased area of contact prevents any overload of the other hand structures.

Consequently, you should aim to use the open grip as often as possible, especially when performing dynamic moves.
