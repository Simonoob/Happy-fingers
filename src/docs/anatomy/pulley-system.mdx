## 2 structures working together

The digital flexor sheath and the pulley ligaments act together to maintain the flexor tendons close to the bone. The closer the tendons are to the bone, the more efficient the transfer of force will be (from the muscles in the forearm to the movement of the digits).

## Injury

Whenever the system is damaged, the optimal path of the tendon is compromised, especially if one of the pulleys raptures. This condition is called bowstring, and it severely impacts force production during flexion. The muscles can still produce force, however, this energy is not transmitted effectively to the fingertip.
