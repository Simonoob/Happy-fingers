## muscles

The muscles involved in the [flexor-pulley system](pulley-system) of the digits are 2:

- Flexor digitorum profundus
- Flexor digitorum superficialis

The main function of these two muscles is to flex the wrist, the metacarpophalangeal and the interphalangeal joints of the four fingers.

## Digital flexor sheath

The tendons of these 2 muscles run inside the digital flexor sheath, that being attached to the bones, keeps them close to the phalanges. This setup allows for an effective transfer of force when flexing the finger.

However, the digital flexor sheath is a synovial membrane. This means that it is very elastic and able to follow the movements of the finger. However, this structure alone is not strong enough to keep the tendons close to the bones.
