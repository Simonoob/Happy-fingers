## Overview and function

The pulleys are ligaments. Ligaments are bands of dense connective tissue. Their main purpose is usually to limit movement and give support to the joints.
In this case, they support the flexor tendon sheath and keep the fleors' tendons close to the phalanges.

There are 5 annular pulleys per digit and 3 cruciform pulleys. The ligaments are numbered from [proximal to distal](https://teachmeanatomy.info/the-basics/anatomical-terminology/terms-of-location/).
The function of the pulleys can be compared to one of the eyelets in a fishing rod.

The most important pulleys for us are the annular pulleys, since they are the ones most frequently injured during climbing.

Annular pulleys vary in function and structure depending on their location.
In particular, A2 and A4 are true fibro-osseous pulleys, making them the strongest. The others (A1, A3 and A5) are more flexible in order to allow for compression during flexion of the digit without "squeezing" the tendon.
